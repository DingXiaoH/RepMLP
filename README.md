# RepMLP
RepMLP: Re-parameterizing Convolutions into Fully-connected Layers for Image Recognition

Released the code of RepMLP together with an example of checking the equivalence between a training-time and an inference-time RepMLP.

Just check it by
```
python repmlp.py
```

Will be updated in several days.
